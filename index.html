                <p>This is a 4IR application which reduces congestion at the port by taking cognisance of the time period the gantry crane takes to off load and pace a container on a truck, that cycle time interval is then displayed to all the trucks scheduled for entry into the port so that they know as to whether to arrive early or late because if there is a delay the cycle time changes and is made transparent to all the trucks so that they act accordingly.</p>
